      <P>We have been paying close attention to your suggestions, and are working hard to integrate them in our development plans. The following is our features update for the month of July, designed to help you access information and improve communication efficiency.</P>

   <h4>Simple real-time discussion</h4>
     
     

    <p>You can now find your group’s email address at the bottom of the group discussion page. Group administrators can create a unique group email address with the format <a href="mailto:xxxxx@ushigroup.com">xxxxx@ushigroup.com</a>For example, Internet Startup Bootcamp group has set the group email address to be<a href="mailto:internet@ushigroup.com">internet@ushigroup.com</a>You can also reply to a group email to comment on a discussion. This way, you can exchange ideas with group members without needing to sign into Ushi. You can even use your mobile phone’s email client to reply on the go!</p>

    <h4>Email notifications: you have total control</h4>
    <p>Never miss valuable information again by receiving email notifications of group updates. You can select the frequency of these email notifications – whenever there are new topics and/or new replies; daily group digest; or a weekly group digest.<p>
        On the right sidebar of the group page, click on “personal settings” to customize your settings.</p>

    <h4>Organize events easily and conveniently</h4>
    <p>Organizing group events is now better. Not only can you organize and participate in events within your groups, you can now send invitations to your contacts not on Ushi as well. When your contacts sign up for the event, they will also become group members.</p>

    </p>
    <h4>Group Settings
    </h4>
    <p>Members are free to decide which groups to display on their profiles, and which to be hidden, if they so wish. You can also set whether to allow other group members to send a message to you.</p>
      <p>For group administrators, enter “Settings” under the “Administration” tab to write a customized message for group applicants, as well as a welcome email to new group members.</p>
