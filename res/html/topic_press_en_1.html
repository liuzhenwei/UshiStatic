    <p>On 19th October 2010, at Shanghai's landmark Waldorf Astoria Hotel on the Bund, Ushi launched a new chapter in its mission to help millions of professionals in China to accelerate their careers. In the building full of classic charm, Ushi held an official launch and press conference. More than 50 Chinese and foreign journalists and nearly 20 Ushi Charter Members came together, witnessing the exciting moment with the Ushi management team. 

</p>
    
    <p>The Waldorf Astoria Hotel is situated in the original location of the Shanghai Club of the 1920s. Generations ago, it was the site for the business elite. It was a unique backdrop for Ushi's new elite business networking service. The other theme of this press conference was the celebration of the successful close of nearly RMB 10 million investment by leading investors. Ushi's CEO Dominic Penaloza said that personal success relies on connections and national competitiveness relies on efficiency of business networking. Ushi helps people network more efficiently and creates  a better business environment for China.</p>
